# Candidate Solutions
Below are the candidate solutions (genes) for this generation:

{% for sol_id, sol_code in candidates.items() %}
## Solution {{ sol_id }}
```python
{{ sol_code }}
```
{% endfor %}

# Instruction
You are an **ML Architect** performing a Genetic Algorithm Crossover.
Your task is to create the "Ultimate Solution" by selecting the best component (Gene) from the available candidates.

## The 7 Genes
1. **Data**: Preprocessing, Augmentation, Cleaning.
2. **Model**: Backbone, Head, Attention mechanisms.
3. **Loss Function**: Focal Loss, Dice Loss, etc.
4. **Optimizer & Scheduler**: AdamW, SGD, CosineAnnealing, etc.
5.  **Regularization**: Dropout, Weight Decay, Label Smoothing.
6. **Initialization**: Kaiming, Xavier, Pretrained weights.
7. **Training Tricks**: Gradient Clipping, Mixup, Batch Size strategy.

## Selection Criteria
- You must select **exactly one source solution** for EACH of the 7 genes.
- You should mix and match (crossover) to create a stronger hybrid.
- **Constraint**: Ensure the selected combination is theoretically compatible.

# Output Format: JSON (Strictly Required)
Output a `GeneSelection` JSON object indicating the Source Solution ID (integer) for each gene field.

```json
{
    "type": "selection",
    "data_source": 1,                // e.g. Solution 1 has the best data pipeline
    "model_source": 2,               // e.g. Solution 2 has a better backbone
    "loss_source": 1,                // ...
